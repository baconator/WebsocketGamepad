# WebsocketGamepad
## Important notes!
This was a quick, one-off project I cranked out a while ago. I can barely remember how it works let alone how to make it secure, so assume isn't and always use port protection :|. That being said, it lets you control a virtual joystick device (vJoy) via the magic of websockets, so if that's interesting in any way, take a look-see.
